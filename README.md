# üçã Little Lemon Restaurant ‚Äì Reservation Web App
This project is the Capstone for my Front-End Development course, built around a real-world scenario involving the Little Lemon restaurant.

## üîß Project Overview
The Little Lemon team received negative feedback regarding their table reservation feature ‚Äî users found it confusing, outdated, and difficult to use. My task was to redesign and develop a responsive, modern web application that improves the user experience for reserving a table.

![React App (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8550214e-f77f-4216-89f1-42dcb1b52215)

This project demonstrates the culmination of the skills and technologies I‚Äôve learned throughout the program, including:

- Responsive design 
- React.js and component-based architecture
- React Router for navigation
- Form handling and validation
- Accessibility best practices
- UI/UX principles for clarity and usability


## üí° Objective
Create a user-friendly interface that makes it simple and intuitive for customers to book a reservation, no matter what device they‚Äôre using. The result is a fully functional front-end app with a clean UI and improved usability.
